# RAG with Cohere's Command-R+ LLM.
This project facilitates conversational interactions with PDF documents through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. Users can upload PDF files and ask questions based on the content, receiving detailed responses generated using RAG-based conversational techniques. The system leverages Cohere's Command R+ model for fast and efficient performance, and features a Gradio interface for seamless user interactions.
